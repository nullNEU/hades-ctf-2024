A program is provided by Hera, which is actually a rudimentary "Hello, World!" executable.

In reality, there is a pcap file and a sslkeylog file embedded in the executable, which after extraction and analysis via Wireshark will result in the flag "hadesctf{acc6f2140baf9cb0b40b8088e0d4166b78314958c22692a894c1ecf48e0330d1}".
